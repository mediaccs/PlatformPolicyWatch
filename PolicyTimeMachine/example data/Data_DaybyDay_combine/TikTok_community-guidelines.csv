20230228,none,October 2022,"Introduction Last updated, October 2022 TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone. At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok. Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the  tools we provide on TikTok   to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines. We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full  TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. ( In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections. ) Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section. At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy. Minor safety We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities. Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our  Terms of Service . When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed. Account holders must be at least 18 years old to host a livestream or use our virtual gifting features. Sexual exploitation of minors TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a  suicide prevention  hotline . In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services.

We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death.

Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies. Do not post, upload, stream, or share: Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights Platform security A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited. Do not: Attempt to access the TikTok platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or misleading versions of the TikTok platform Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform Use automated scripts, web crawling, software, deceptive techniques, or any other way to attempt to obtain, acquire, or request login credentials or other sensitive information, including non-public data, from TikTok or its users Leverage TikTok accounts under false or fraudulent pretenses to distribute spam, phishing, or smishing content in an attempt to perpetrate cybercrime or gain unauthorized access to others’ content, accounts, systems, or data Modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or create any derivative products based on TikTok, including any files, tables or documentation, or attempt to regenerate any source code, algorithms, methods, or techniques embodied in TikTok Provide access to your account credentials to others or enable others to conduct activities against our Community Guidelines Click on suspicious links or engage in requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, or other personal information Ineligible for the For You feed The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is  based on  a personalized recommendation system .  Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation. Minor safety Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18. Dangerous stunts and sports Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public). Overtly sexualized content We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases). Tobacco and alcohol products TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well. Violent and graphic content Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning. Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation. Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users.

Introduction Last updated, October 2022 TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the world. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone. At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly.  We prize the global nature of our community and strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on TikTok. Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on TikTok. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to use the  tools we provide on TikTok   to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines. We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full  TikTok experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. ( In the US, we accommodate people under 13 in TikTok for Younger Users, a limited app experience designed specifically for this audience with additional safeguards and privacy protections. ) Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section. At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, artistic, or satirical content, content in fictional or professional settings, counterspeech, or content that otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. To minimize the potentially negative impact of graphic content, we may first include safety measures such as an “opt-in” screen or warning. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy. Minor safety We are deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. TikTok defines a minor as any person under the age of 18. We prohibit activities that perpetuate the abuse, harm, endangerment, or exploitation of minors on TikTok. Any content, including animation or digitally created or manipulated media, that depicts abuse, exploitation, or endangerment of minors is a violation on our platform and will be removed when detected. We report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and supporting evidence  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and to any additional relevant legal authorities. Our users must meet the minimum age requirements to use TikTok, as stipulated in our  Terms of Service . When an underage account is identified, we remove it. Given our platform is designed with the safety of minors in mind, some of our features are age restricted. Account holders who are under the age of 16 cannot use direct messaging and their content is not eligible to appear in the For You feed. Account holders must be at least 18 years old to host a livestream or use our virtual gifting features. Sexual exploitation of minors TikTok will take action on any content or accounts involving CSAM or sexual exploitation of a minor. Sexual exploitation of minors includes any abuse of a position of power or trust for sexual purposes, including profiting financially, socially, sexually, or politically from the exploitation of a minor. CSAM is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit nudity or conduct of a minor, whether captured by predatory adults, peers, or self-generated by minors.

We also encourage individuals who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or who know someone is seriously considering suicide, to immediately contact local emergency services or a  suicide prevention  hotline . In the event that our intervention could help a user who may be at risk of harming themselves, TikTok may also alert local emergency services. Suicide and self-harm We remove content that depicts suicide, involves suicidal ideation, or that might encourage suicidal or self-injurious behavior. We also remove content that depicts attempted suicide or behavior likely to lead to self-inflicted death. We prohibit any form of content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies suicide, provides instructions for suicide, or posts that portray a suicide as heroic or honorable. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities.

When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider off-platform behavior to identify violent extremist organizations and individuals on our platform. If we find such organizations or individuals, we will ban their accounts.

A trademark is a word, symbol, slogan, or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a product or service. We encourage everyone to create and share original content. Content that infringes someone else's intellectual property rights is prohibited on our platform and will be removed if we become aware of it. The use of copyrighted work under certain circumstances, such as the fair use doctrine or other applicable laws, or the use of a trademark to reference, lawfully comment, criticize, parody, make a fan page, or review a product or service, may not be considered a violation of our policies. Do not post, upload, stream, or share: Content that violates or infringes someone else's copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights Platform security A top priority for TikTok is the safety and security of our users, creators, business partners, vendors, and employee data, including their personal information, accounts, profiles, content, and other proprietary information, as well as our product and services. We do not allow access to the TikTok platform -- which includes our website, app, network, and associated infrastructure or networks -- through unauthorized methods, or to obtain sensitive confidential commercial or personal information. Any attempt to undermine or abuse the security, integrity or reliability of our platform, products, or services is expressly prohibited. Do not: Attempt to access the TikTok platform in an unauthorized manner, and do not create fake or misleading versions of the TikTok platform Create or distribute malicious files, content, or messages that contain viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other materials that may be harmful to the community or platform Use automated scripts, web crawling, software, deceptive techniques, or any other way to attempt to obtain, acquire, or request login credentials or other sensitive information, including non-public data, from TikTok or its users Leverage TikTok accounts under false or fraudulent pretenses to distribute spam, phishing, or smishing content in an attempt to perpetrate cybercrime or gain unauthorized access to others’ content, accounts, systems, or data Modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or create any derivative products based on TikTok, including any files, tables or documentation, or attempt to regenerate any source code, algorithms, methods, or techniques embodied in TikTok Provide access to your account credentials to others or enable others to conduct activities against our Community Guidelines Click on suspicious links or engage in requests for information about your TikTok account details, passwords, verification qualification, financial, or other personal information Ineligible for the For You feed The goal of the For You feed (FYF) is to provide original content that honors our mission of inspiring creativity and bringing joy to our diverse community around the world. Each account holder’s FYF is  based on  a personalized recommendation system .  Our recommendation system is designed with user safety as a primary consideration, meaning that some content may not be eligible for recommendation. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, the FYF is intended for a general audience that includes everyone from our teenage users to great grandparents. We consider the breadth of our audience when we determine what content is eligible for algorithmic promotion on the platform. Provided that it does not violate local laws, the following types of content may be allowed on our platform, searchable, and viewed in Following feeds but not eligible for recommendation. Minor safety Minors’ sense of judgment and identity mature as they develop. To provide teens with additional room for identity exploration and expression in digital spaces, content uploaded by users under the age of 16 is not eligible for recommendation. We strive to encourage healthy development across all ages. The promotion of cosmetic surgery to minors may lead to higher rates of body dissatisfaction. Accordingly, such content -- including before-and-after videos, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery without warning of risks -- are ineligible for the FYF of all users under the age of 18. Dangerous stunts and sports Certain activities can be risky or dangerous when replicated without safety precautions, which could lead to physical harm. Content that includes dangerous stunts, or extreme sports performed by non-professionals, may be ineligible. (We remove content that depicts dangerous acts and challenges performed by non-professionals, which may lead to serious injury or death for the user or the public). Overtly sexualized content We are mindful that not all content may be suitable for all users (particularly our teenage users) and/or may be culturally inappropriate in certain regions. To help maintain a comfortable and age-appropriate experience, content that is overtly sexually suggestive may not be eligible for recommendation. This would include content that depicts implied nudity, sexualizes body parts, or is blatantly erotic or sensual (e.g., strip teases). Tobacco and alcohol products TikTok is deeply committed to protecting the safety of minors on our platform. Content promoting, mentioning, or depicting alcohol products consumed by persons of legal drinking age but done so in a dangerous fashion may not be eligible for recommendation. Content depicting the use of tobacco products by adults or mentioning controlled substances is not eligible for recommendation. Please remember that content which suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or drugs by a minor is prohibited. Content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances is prohibited per our Community Guidelines as well. Violent and graphic content Our community celebrates creativity, but shock value isn't everyone's preference. Content that can cause discomfort, shock or disgust to viewers may be ineligible for the FYF, including scary effects, jump scares, makeup that realistically replicates gory wounds, or depictions of bodily functions. Most violent and graphic content is not allowed on TikTok; however, in certain situations we may not remove some types of this content such as depictions of graphic deaths, accidents or fighting when real world events are being documented and it is in the public interest. Since this content isn't appropriate for all audiences, it will not be eligible for recommendation and the content will include an “opt-in” screen or warning. Spam, inauthentic, or misleading content We value authenticity and accuracy. We make ineligible for the FYF any content that tricks or manipulates users in order to inauthentically increase followers, likes, views, or other engagement metrics on the platform, including follow-to-follow, like-to-like, and misleading or manipulating users into clicking like or share buttons. Conspiratorial content that counters generally accepted beliefs and casts blame on a group or entity (rather than any living individual) or that includes potentially misleading and harmful content about current, unfolding events where details are still developing, are also ineligible for recommendation. Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code content Original and entertaining content form the core of the TikTok community. To maintain the positive experience our users expect from the TikTok platform, unoriginal and low-quality content is ineligible for recommendation. We consider content not original if it is imported or uploaded from TikTok, other platforms, or other sources including television, movies, or webcasts, and the user has not added new, creative edits. One indicator that the content is not original is a visible watermark or superimposed logo. Low quality content includes extremely short clips, static images, and exclusively-GIF based videos. Content that includes QR codes is usually ineligible for the FYF because it can lead users to harmful websites or apps, though we make exceptions in certain circumstances where that risk is low (e.g., e-commerce). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you for being a part of our vibrant global community and working with us to maintain a welcoming space for all users.

Overview
Last updated, March 2023
Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We aspire to unlock human imagination by enabling creative expression and being a source of entertainment and enrichment everywhere. We welcome people from around the world, as they come to TikTok to discover a diversity of ideas, creators, and products, and to connect with others in our community. To help ensure a safe, trustworthy, and vibrant experience, we maintain a set of Community Guidelines that include rules and standards for using TikTok. The guidelines apply to everyone and everything on our platform. They are informed by international legal frameworks, industry best practices, and input from our community, safety and public health experts, and our regional Advisory Councils. We evolve them to address emerging risks and potential harms that may occur from new behaviors.Our approach to content moderation is built on four pillars: Remove violative content  from the platform that breaks our rules Age-restrict mature content  so it is only viewed by adults (18 years and older) Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards  to help ensure any content that may be promoted by our recommendation system is appropriate for a broad audience Empower our community  with information, tools, and resources
Our guidelines are organized by topic area, with each rule in bold. Under each section you can click for more information where you can find definitions, specific examples, and clarifications to common questions about what is allowed. Please be aware that the examples do not cover everything (we note this upfront so you don’t have to repeatedly read the phrase “including, but not limited to”).If you are ever in doubt about what to share, keep in mind this core value — “be kind and treat others the way that you would want to be treated.” Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone! More information
Keeping our community both safe and vibrant requires finding the right balance between enabling expression and preventing harm. We do this through a mix of safety approaches, from developing rules and standards that we enforce, to building platform norms and resources that give our community members more agency and choice. Remove violative content.  Everyone joins TikTok with the ability to freely share content on our platform. However, we have rules regarding harmful content that we do not allow. We seek to remove any content, whether publicly posted or private, that violates our rules. Although we work hard to enforce our rules, we cannot guarantee that all content shared on TikTok complies with our  Terms of Service  or Community Guidelines. If someone has severe or repeated violations, we will also ban the account. Information on account-level enforcement can be found  here . Age-restrict mature content.  The breadth of content that is shared on TikTok is vast, which adds to the rich diversity of the experience. However, not all of it may be suitable for younger audiences. We limit overtly mature content so it is only viewed by adults 18 years and older. A summary of age-restricted content can be found  here . Maintain For You feed (FYF) eligibility standards.  The FYF offers an opportunity for viewers to discover new content and for creators to reach new audiences. But promotion by our recommendation system is not guaranteed. Content that is not appropriate for a broad audience will be ineligible for the FYF. A summary of these standards can be found  here . Empower our community.  We want to make sure you have the right information to help you manage your experience on TikTok. For certain content, we add labels, “opt-in” screens, or warnings to provide more context or notice. Our  safety toolkit  helps you to filter out any content with specific hashtags or comments that you are not comfortable seeing. We also offer  account controls  and in-app features with  safety resources .

Community Principles
Last updated, March 2023
TikTok has eight guiding community principles that help embody our  commitment to human rights . Our principles are centered on balancing expression with harm prevention, embracing human dignity, and ensuring our actions are fair. They shape our day-to-day work and guide how we approach difficult enforcement decisions.
Balance Prevent harm Enable free expression
Dignity Foster civility Respect local context Champion inclusion Protect individual privacy
Fairness Provide transparency and consistency Be fair and just More information
Our content moderation principles and practices are informed by the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  and the  Santa Clara Principles , and we seek to align with international legal frameworks, such as the  International Bill of Human Rights  and the  Convention on the Rights of Children . We recognize that sometimes these principles may be in tension with each other, and we make trade-offs carefully. Prevent harm:  Our primary focus is keeping our community safe, fostering inclusivity, and ensuring TikTok is a place for joy. We consider the many ways that content or behaviors may cause harm to individuals or our diverse community. This includes physical, psychological, financial, privacy, and societal harms. To strike the right balance with free expression, we restrict content only when necessary and in a way that seeks to minimize the impact on speech. Enable free expression:  The creativity unlocked by  expression  is what powers our vibrant community. We honor this human right by providing the opportunity to share freely on our platform and by proactively removing harassing behavior that can inhibit creator speech. However, free expression is not an absolute right – it is always considered in proportion to its potential harm. It also does not extend to a right to have your content amplified in the For You feed. Foster civility:  Civility creates respect between people and helps communities thrive. The way we engage with each other online can sometimes threaten positive interactions with others, so being civil on TikTok is critical to fulfilling our mission. This means acknowledging everyone’s  inherent dignity  and conducting ourselves as if we were face-to-face. To ensure space for free expression, we do allow more latitude for social critique of public figures. Respect local context:  TikTok brings together over a billion people across 150+ countries in one shared digital space. We work with regional experts and local communities to help ensure that our global approach recognizes local cultural norms. We adopt regional applications of our guidelines to ensure we do not impose one region’s values on another, while also embracing a baseline of internationally recognized human rights. Champion inclusion:  We want people from around the world to feel welcome on our platform. We value and celebrate different cultures, identities, appearances, viewpoints, interests, and experiences. We know some communities historically have been afforded fewer opportunities for engagement, so we are committed to the human right of  equal protection , equity, and mitigating harms that disproportionately affect marginalized or underrepresented groups. Protect individual privacy : The right to  privacy  provides people a sense of autonomy, comfort, and security. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of our community. We seek to ensure that content shared on the platform does not expose anyone’s personal information or invade their intimate privacy. Provide transparency and consistency : Our community members have a right to know what our rules are and how we apply them. We seek to provide clear notice of our policies and practices, to apply them consistently and equitably, and to share our enforcement efforts in our  Transparency Center . We will be transparent throughout the guidelines when we need to prioritize another principle over consistency, such as local context or inclusion. Be fair and just:  Moderating millions of pieces of content each day is a complex effort, and developing a trusted process to do so is critical. We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal content removals, LIVE suspensions, and account bans.

Youth Safety and Well-Being
Last updated, March 2023
We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18 (we refer to them as “youth” or “young people”). This starts by being old enough to use TikTok.  You must be 13 years and older to have an account.  There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate  under 13 TikTok experience , which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated  Privacy Policy . If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. If an account holder believes they were incorrectly banned, they can  appeal  the decision. Community members can report those who they believe are under the minimum age, either  in-app  or  online .
Youth safety is our priority. We do not allow content that may put young people at risk of exploitation, or psychological, physical, or developmental harm. This includes child sexual abuse material (CSAM), youth abuse, bullying, dangerous activities and challenges, exposure to overtly mature themes, and consumption of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or regulated substances. If we become aware of youth exploitation on our platform, we will ban the account, as well as any other accounts belonging to the person.
Our goal is to provide young people with an experience that is developmentally appropriate and helps to ensure a safe space for self-exploration. We take several steps including: (1) limiting access to  certain product features , (2) developing  Content Levels  that sort content by levels of thematic comfort, (3) using restrictive  default privacy settings , and (4) making content created by anyone under 16 ineligible for the For You feed (FYF).  You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages, and be 18 years and older to go LIVE, to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session, or to use monetization features.  You can learn more about TikTok’s tools, controls, and educational content on our  Youth Portal  and in our  Guardian’s Guide .
In the sections that follow, we have many policies to promote youth safety on the platform. Click for more information and a consolidated list of all youth-specific policies. More information Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)  refers to any sexualized material of a young person that is shared or created by anyone, including  self-generated CSAM . It includes implied or clearly visible sexual activities and sexual assault of young people, as well as the sexualization or fetishization of their body.  Significant body exposure  includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear. Moderate body exposure  includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh. Seductive performances  involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling. Sexualized posing  is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”). Allusion to sexual activity  is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm).

Safety and Civility
Last updated, March 2023
Physical and psychological safety form the foundation of individual well-being, and civility is the key to a thriving community. Being civil does not mean people must always agree, but rather it is about recognizing everyone’s inherent dignity and being respectful in action, words, and tone when engaging others.
Violent Behaviors and Criminal Activities
We are committed to bringing people together in a way that does not lead to physical conflict. We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm.  We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property.  If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.

Protected attributes  are personal characteristics that we are born with, are immutable, or cannot change without severe psychological harm, and which may result in disproportionate stigmatization. In addition, we also provide some protections related to age, and may consider other protected attributes when we have additional context, such as specific regional information provided to us by a local non-governmental organization (NGO). The attributes above are informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions. NOT allowed
Promoting violence, exclusion, segregation, discrimination, and other harms on the basis of a protected attribute
Promoting any hateful ideology or claiming supremacy over a group of people on the basis of protected attributes

Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals
We want our creators to share what inspires them, but there is no place on our platform for those dedicated to spreading beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate.  We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform.  These actors include violent extremists, violent criminal organizations, violent political organizations, hateful organizations, and individual perpetrators of mass violence. If we become aware that any such actor may be on our platform, we will conduct a thorough review – including off-platform behavior – which may result in an  account ban .
Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others.  We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.  Content that may appear neutral, such as referencing a quote from a hateful organization, must make clear that there is no intent to promote it.We make limited allowances for people to discuss violent political organizations, but only if: (1) their causes are recognized as legitimate under international legal frameworks, (2) they do not primarily target civilians, and (3) the content does not mention violence. More information Violent extremists  are non-state groups, including those  designated by the United Nations , that threaten or use violence against civilians for political, religious, ethnic, or ideological reasons. Criminal organizations  are transnational, national, or local groups that commit serious crimes, including violence, trafficking, kidnapping, financial crimes, and cybercrime. Violent political organizations  are non-state groups that commit violent acts that primarily target non-civilians and are acting legitimately under a right of self determination according to international law, such as the United Nations Charter, a United Nations resolution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the international Court of Justice (ICJ).

non
-harassing counter speech). 
We allow some critical comments of public figures, understanding that they are in a position of public attention and have ways to counter negative speech, and that the critique may be in the  public interest  to view.

Sensitive and Mature Themes
Last updated, March 2023
TikTok provides content that ranges from very family friendly to more mature. Given the diversity of our global community, developmental and cultural considerations inform our approach to potentially sensitive and more mature content that may be considered offensive by some. To honor our principle of  respecting local context  and not imposing the norms of one country on another, some of the exceptions to the guidelines in this section differ across regions.
Sexual Activity and Services
TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health. We are mindful that certain content may not be appropriate for young people, may be considered offensive by some, or may create the potential for exploitation.  We do not allow sexual activity or services.  This includes sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services. However, it does not include reproductive health and sex education content. More information Sexual activity  includes sex, sexual arousal, and fetish and kink behavior. Fetish and kink behavior  includes BDSM (bondage, discipline, domination, submission, sadism, and masochism), and sexual behaviors with non-human objects or with specific body parts (such as a foot fetish).

We understand societies approach body exposure and clothing differently, so we seek to reflect prevailing cultural norms about nudity.  We do not allow nudity, including uncovered genitals and buttocks, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls.  Sheer and partially see-through clothing is not considered covered. We allow regional exceptions for showing nipples and areolas in limited situations, such as medical treatment, educational purposes, or as a part of culturally accepted practices.
Not all young people have the developmental maturity to respond to unwanted physical attention and uninvited sexualization, which may lead to psychological or physical harm.  We do not allow significant body exposure of young people. 
Content is age-restricted if it shows significant body exposure of an adult. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows moderate body exposure of a young person, or significant body exposure of an adult. We allow regional exceptions for body exposure in limited situations, such as common cultural practices. More information Nudity  is showing intimate body parts that prevailing cultural norms indicate should be fully covered. This currently includes bare genitals and buttocks of anyone, as well as nipples and areolas of women and girls. It does not apply to nipples and areolas of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary. We recognize that there are individuals who do not describe their gender in binary terms, and acknowledge the complexity of applying this policy. We start by looking at how someone self-describes using first-party information and indicators, such as captions, hashtags, and bio, and then may also look at how the person presents.  Significant body exposure  includes showing part of the pubic area and buttocks, or implied nudity, such as using an object to cover nude genitalia. For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear. Moderate body exposure  includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh. NOT allowed
Nudity of adults, including photography and digitally created images such as manga and anime
Nudity of young people, including visual fine art, objects, photography, and digitally created images such as manga and anime

Areolas and nipples of men and boys (including those who are transgender or intersex), or people who are non-binary
Body exposure that appears in culturally expected contexts, such as athletes wearing sports apparel and swimsuits at a beach or festival
Sexually Suggestive Content
We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation.  We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.  We do allow some artistic content with sexual references, such as song lyrics.
Content is age-restricted if it shows seductive performances or sexualized posing by adults, or allusions to sexual activity by adults. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows sex products or intends to sexually arouse (such as intimate kissing, sexualized posing, and seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by adults). More information Intent  is referenced to be clear that other people finding you sexually arousing is not against the rules. However, we also acknowledge intent can be subjective. To help us understand it, we use objective indicators such as captions, hashtags, bio, and sounds. We also recognize that different regions have varying views on what is considered sexually suggestive, which further informs our assessment. Seductive performances  involve certain body movements that are intended to be sexually arousing, such as undressing (stripteases), pelvic thrusting, breast shaking, and fondling. Sexualized posing  is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”). Allusion to sexual activity  is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm). NOT allowed

Shocking and Graphic Content
Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort.  We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content.
Content is age-restricted if it shows human or animal blood. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it shows fictional violence, blood, potentially distressing or mildly graphic material, animal genitalia or sexual activity between animals. Content is also ineligible for the FYF if it contains graphic footage of events that are in the  public interest  to view.

Integrity and Authenticity
Last updated, March 2023
We want everyone to feel confident that they can access information that is reliable, discover content that is original, and engage with people who are authentic. This is foundational to building a community of trust and accountability both on TikTok and off-platform.
Misinformation
In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality.  We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.  Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage. It does not extend to commercial and reputational harm, nor does it cover simply inaccurate information and myths. We rely on  independent fact-checking partners  and our database of previously fact-checked claims to help assess the accuracy of content.
Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains general conspiracy theories or unverified information related to emergencies. To be cautious, content that warrants fact-checking is also temporarily ineligible for the FYF while it is undergoing review. 
To help you manage your TikTok experience, we add warning labels to content related to unfolding or emergency events which have been assessed by our fact-checkers but cannot be verified as accurate, and we prompt people to  reconsider sharing  such content. More information Misinformation  includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content. Significant harm  includes severe forms of:
Physical injury and illness, including death
Psychological trauma
Large-scale property damage
Societal harm, including undermining fundamental social processes or institutions, such as democratic elections, and processes that maintain public health and public safety Conspiracy theories  are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups. NOT allowed
Misinformation that poses a risk to public safety or may induce panic about a crisis event or emergency, including using historical footage of a previous attack as if it were current, or incorrectly claiming a basic necessity (such as food or water) is no longer available in a particular location
Medical misinformation, such as misleading statements about vaccines, inaccurate medical advice that discourages people from getting appropriate medical care for a life-threatening disease, and other misinformation that poses a risk to public health
Climate change misinformation that undermines well-established scientific consensus, such as denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it
Dangerous conspiracy theories that are violent or hateful, such as making a violent call to action, having links to previous violence, denying well-documented violent events, and causing prejudice towards a group with a protected attribute
Specific conspiracy theories that name and attack individual people
Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events FYF  ineligible
General conspiracy theories that are unfounded and claim that certain events or situations are carried out by covert or powerful groups, such as “the government” or a “secret society”

Potential high-harm misinformation while it is undergoing a fact-checking review Allowed
Statements of personal opinion (as long as it does not include harmful misinformation)
Discussions about climate change, such as the benefits or disadvantages of particular policies or technologies, or personal views related to specific weather events (as long as it does not undermine scientific consensus)
Civic and Election Integrity
Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We try to balance enabling topical discussions, while also being a platform that brings us together and does not divide us.  We do not allow paid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others).  Our  political ads policy  includes both traditional paid ads and creators receiving compensation to support or oppose a candidate for office.
We want to enable the informed exchange of civic ideas in a way that fosters productive dialogue.  We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.  This includes misinformation about how to vote, registering to vote, eligibility requirements of candidates, the processes to count ballots and certify elections, and the final outcome of an election.
Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains unverified claims about the outcome of an election.
Learn more about  Government, Politician and Political Party accounts , and our  election integrity  work. More information Misinformation  includes inaccurate, misleading, or false content. NOT allowed
Election misinformation, including the following:

Final results or outcome of an election FYF  ineligible
Unverified claims about the outcome of an election that is still unfolding and may be false or misleading
Synthetic and Manipulated Media
We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, carrying both societal and individual risks.  Synthetic or manipulated  media  that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed.  This can be done through the use of a sticker or caption, such as ‘synthetic’, ‘fake’, ‘not real’, or ‘altered’. 
We balance the expressive value that synthetic media has against the risk of harms to individuals.  We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure.  While we provide more latitude for public figures, we do not want them to be the subject of abuse, or for people to be misled about political or financial issues.  We do not allow synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.  This includes prohibitions on hate speech, sexual exploitation, and serious forms of harassment (learn more about public figures in  Harassment and Bullying ). More information Synthetic media  is content created or modified by AI technology. It includes highly realistic digitally-created (fake) content of real people, such as a video of a real person speaking but their words have been modified or changed. Realistic scenes  include showing fake people, places or events that look like they are real. Public figures  are adults (18 years and older) with a significant public role, such as a government official, politician, business leader, and celebrity. We do not identify people under the age of 18 as public figures. NOT allowed
Synthetic media showing realistic scenes that are not prominently disclosed or labeled in the video
Synthetic media that contains the likeness (visual or audio) of a real person, including: (1) a young person, (2) an adult private figure, and (3) an adult public figure when used for political or commercial endorsements, or if it violates any other policy
Material that has been edited, spliced, or combined (such as video and audio) in a way that may mislead a person about real-world events Allowed
Synthetic media showing a public figure in certain contexts, including artistic and educational content, such as a video showing a celebrity doing a popular TikTok dance, and a historical figure featured in a history lesson
Fake Engagement
Authentic engagement is central to the integrity of our platform and informs how we recommend content that others may find interesting.  We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.  If we become aware of accounts or content with inauthentically inflated metrics, we will remove the associated fake followers or likes. 
Content is ineligible for the FYF if it seeks to trick or manipulate others to increase followers, likes, or views. More information NOT allowed

Unoriginal Content and QR Codes
The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work.  We do not allow content that violates someone else’s intellectual property rights.  If we become aware of content that is a violation, we will remove it. Learn more about our  intellectual property (IP) policies .
Content is ineligible for the FYF if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.
If you believe you have experienced an IP violation, you can file a  copyright report  or a  trademark report . More information Intellectual property  refers to the ownership of something that you created, which includes copyright and trademarks. Copyrights  are legal rights related to original works of authorship, including music and videos. Copyrights protect the original expression of an idea (such as the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but do not protect underlying ideas and facts. Trademarks  are words, symbols, slogans, designs, or a combination of these that identifies the source of a product or service and distinguishes it from other products or services. NOT allowed
Content that violates someone else’s copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights FYF  ineligible
Reproduced or unoriginal content that is imported or uploaded without any new or creative edits, such as content with someone else’s visible watermark or superimposed logo
Low quality content, such as extremely short clips and exclusively-GIF based videos
QR codes (unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce)
Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors
To build a trusted community online, it is important that the behaviors and identities of accounts are authentic and truthful.  We do not allow account behaviors that may spam or mislead our community.  This includes conducting covert influence operations, and operating spam or impersonation accounts. Parody/fan-based accounts are allowed, as long as they are disclosed in the 
account
 name (note that this is different than the @username).
You can set up multiple accounts on TikTok to create different channels for authentic creative expression, but not for deceptive purposes.  We do not allow the use of multiple accounts to intentionally bypass our rules or their enforcement.  If any of your accounts have been banned, or restricted from using a feature, you must not set up or use a different account to get around the ban or restriction.
If we determine someone has engaged in any of these deceptive account behaviors, we will  ban the account , and may ban any new accounts that are created. More information NOT allowed Spam ,  including
Accounts that are operated: (1) in bulk, (2) through unauthorized automation, or (3) in order to distribute high-volume commercial content

Attempting to avoid an account ban by spreading content violations across multiple accounts
Using an alternative account (either a new or existing one) to continue the violating behavior that previously resulted in a ban on a different account
Opening a new account after an account has been banned for a severe violation

Regulated Goods and Commercial Activities
Last updated, March 2023
We want everyone on TikTok to have access to information that can support them in making informed choices about their personal health and finances. To ensure we provide a space for people to learn without undue risk of physical or financial harm, we moderate content that involves goods or activities that may be risky, addictive, dangerous, fraudulent, or otherwise require a higher degree of care. For certain goods and services (such as gambling and alcohol), we make limited exceptions for paid ads by advertisers with TikTok’s explicit permission, provided they are compliant with all relevant age-targeting restrictions, laws, and regulations (learn more about our  advertisement policy ).

We do not allow the trade of firearms or explosive weapons, or content showing or promoting them if they are not used in a safe or appropriate setting.

For You feed Eligibility Standards
Last updated, March 2023
The For You feed (FYF) is a unique TikTok feature that uses a personalized recommendation system to allow each community member the ability to discover a breadth of content, creators, and topics. In determining what gets recommended, the system takes into account factors such as likes, shares, comments, searches, diversity of content, and popular videos. Learn more about the  recommendation system , as well as  tools to help customize  recommendations.
Certain types of content may be fine if seen occasionally, but problematic if viewed in clusters (such as videos that involve dieting, extreme fitness, sadness, or sexual suggestiveness). This type of content may be eligible for the FYF but, to protect our community, we will interrupt repetitive content patterns to ensure it is not viewed too often. Learn more about our approach to  safeguarding and diversifying  recommendations.
We maintain content eligibility standards for the FYF that prioritize safety and are informed by the diversity of our community and cultural norms. While the spontaneity of the FYF is what makes TikTok unique, it is intended for a range of audiences that includes everyone from teenagers to great grandparents.  We make ineligible for the FYF certain content that may not be appropriate for a broad audience related to: (1) Behavioral Health, (2) Sensitive and Mature Themes, (3) Integrity and Authenticity, and (4) Regulated Goods.  We may also make some of this content harder to find in search.
We also know that the FYF opens creators to a large audience, which is not always appropriate for some young people. To give youth suitable room for exploration, we also do not make eligible for the FYF any content from accounts of creators under the age of 16.
Content that is ineligible for the FYF can still be discovered in other ways, such as through search tools or by following an account. For a consolidated list of the specific types of content that are not eligible for the FYF, refer to “more information” below. More information
The following types of content are allowed on our platform but do not meet our standards for the For You Feed (FYF). For additional discussion, use the links to visit each of the topic areas above. 
It should also be noted that when a video does not get many views, it may be due to a lack of community engagement rather than being ineligible for the FYF. Creators can use the  TikTok analytics tool  to track the performance of their videos.

For young people, it also includes wearing minimal clothing, such as only underwear. Moderate body exposure  includes showing the visible outline of covered genitalia, nipples through clothing, and exposed skin near an intimate body part, such as a part of a breast and the upper part of the thigh. Sexualized posing  is behavior with the intent to sexually arouse, through a combination of: (1) emphasizing intimate body parts, such as by zooming in on genitals, or using hands to frame breasts; and (2) overt sexual expressions, including suggestive captions (such as “do you like what you see?”). Allusion to sexual activity  is behavior with the intent to call to mind sexual activity, including imitating sexual acts (such as licking a phallic-shaped object), sounds (such as moaning), and facial expressions (such as an “O” face to mimic an orgasm). Conspiracy theories  are beliefs about unexplained events or involve rejecting generally accepted explanations for events and suggesting they were carried out by covert or powerful groups. Tobacco products  include vaping products, smokeless or combustible tobacco products, synthetic nicotine products, E-cigarettes, and other Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.

Accounts and Features
Last updated, March 2023
Accounts You must be 13 years and older to have an account.  There are additional age limitations based on local law in some regions. In the United States, there is a separate  under 13 TikTok experience , which provides a more limited experience designed with additional safety protections and a dedicated  Privacy Policy . If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account.
Violating our guidelines can lead to enforcement actions on accounts.  We will ban accounts or users if they engage in: (1) a single severe content violation, (2) repeated content violations within a 90-day period, (3) circumvention, or (4) the operation of accounts dedicated to activity that violates our rules.  This includes all activities that indicate a primary purpose that is not allowed on our platform, such as accounts focused on hate speech, the trade of prohibited goods, spam, and impersonation (learn more about circumvention and dedicated accounts in  Spam and Deceptive Account Behaviors ).
We will also ban an account if we become aware that the account holder is a  violent or hateful actor  or has been convicted of a sexual crime or other serious offense against a young person. We may consider off-platform activity related to violence, hate, and child sexual exploitation and abuse to help make decisions about these account bans. We report accounts to law enforcement authorities if there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury.
Repeatedly posting content that is allowed on our platform but not eligible for the FYF may lead to the account and its content being harder to find in search. Learn more about our general approach to  account enforcement .
Government, Politician, and News Accounts
Governments, politicians, and news entities all play important roles in civic processes and civil society. While we treat their content just like any other account and remove violations, we approach account-level enforcement differently to align with our commitment to human rights and  free expression . These public interest accounts will be banned for any single severe content violation, such as threatening violence. For repeated content violations that are less severe, they will be temporarily ineligible to appear in the FYF and in the feeds of their followers. In limited circumstances, they may also be temporarily restricted from posting new content. Learn more about our approach to  public interest accounts . More information Governments and politicians  include federal/national elected officials and candidates, state/provincial/territorial/local government entities, cabinet ministers, and official spokespeople. Learn more about who is considered to be a  Government, Politician and Political Party account . News entities  include organizations primarily dedicated to publishing news content to inform or educate. To qualify as a news account, the account must be legally licensed, certified or recognized by an intergovernmental organization, regulator, or reputable press organization.

Severe violations include the following:
Showing, promoting, or facilitating youth exploitation and child sexual abuse material (CSAM)
Promoting or threatening violence
Showing or promoting non-consensual sex acts, such as rape and molestation
Facilitating human trafficking
Showing real-world torture
Using another account after a permanent account ban, and continuing to violate our guidelines
External Links
Our community members often share links in their profile, bio, or content to connect people to additional content or to other sites. While some links may be helpful or informative, others connect to harmful content that would not be allowed on our platform.  Do not post links that direct people to content that would violate our guidelines . If we find a link in violation of our guidelines, it will result in the link being removed or an account ban.
It can be difficult to determine where a Quick Response (QR) code image may lead to and whether the connected content will be safe. Content is ineligible for the FYF if it contains QR codes, unless there is a low risk of harm, such as in the context of e-commerce.
Comments and Direct Messages
Comments and direct messages on TikTok allow our users to interact with videos or directly with others, and provide an integral interactive experience to the platform.  You must be 16 years and older to use direct messages.
Our guidelines listed above also apply to comments and messages.  A violation of our rules will result in the removal of the content or a restriction on sending direct messages, and may lead to an account ban.
TikTok LIVE TikTok LIVE  allows our community to interact in real-time. To bolster a safe experience on LIVE, we have a higher minimum age threshold for this feature.  You must be 18 years and older to go LIVE, and to send gifts to a creator during a LIVE session . 
Our guidelines listed above also apply to going LIVE.  A violation of our rules will result in closing an ongoing LIVE session, and may lead to restrictions on using LIVE or an account ban . Repeatedly livestreaming content that is ineligible for the FYF may result in your account not being eligible for the FYF or being harder to find in search.
Monetization
We offer tools that let creators monetize their content, and that give businesses the ability to operate and expand their enterprise.  You must be 18 years and older to use monetization features.
Accounts must satisfy the relevant entry criteria to be eligible for our monetization features.  A violation of our rules may result in a temporary restriction of monetization features, and repeated violations will lead to a permanent restriction or an account ban.  Content that is not eligible in the FYF may be restricted from monetization features.
All commercial content on our platform must comply with the relevant monetized feature policy, such as the  Branded Content Policy ,  TikTok’s Ads Creative Policy ,  Industry Entry Policy , and  TikTok Shop Policies . Commercial content includes exchanging something of value between creators, a third party and creator (such as Branded Content), a creator and business (such as e-commerce), or a creator and TikTok (such as the Creator fund).

Enforcement
Last updated, March 2023
Public Interest Exceptions
We recognize that some content that would otherwise violate our rules can be in the public interest to view. This does not simply refer to what the public may be interested in. Public interest refers to topics that inform, inspire, or educate the community and enhance deliberation about matters of broad collective significance. We may allow content to remain on the platform under one of the following public interest exceptions:
Documentary
Educational
Medical and Scientific
Counterspeech
Satirical
Artistic
Our approach to content moderation uses the same criteria, no matter who creates it. The most important factor we consider in looking at public interest exceptions is context, such as captions, voice over, and similar signals. We encourage creators to clearly show the context to help us in our review process.
We may add extra safety measures to some content allowed under a public interest exception, such as an “opt-in” screen or warning information. We do not provide public interest exceptions for content that may cause extreme harm, such as showing a suicide or sexual abuse of a young person.
Detection and Reporting
We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our guidelines before they are viewed or shared by other people in order to reduce potential harm. Content on TikTok first goes through technology that reviews it against our guidelines. If content is identified as a potential violation, it will be automatically removed, or flagged for additional review by our trust & safety team. Additional review will occur if a video gains popularity or has been reported. Community members can  report  violations in-app and on our website. If you discover content or accounts that may violate our guidelines, please let us know so we can take appropriate action if warranted. Learn more about our enforcement efforts through our  Transparency Center .
Notice and Appeals
In keeping with our commitment to ensuring  procedural fairness , we seek to provide notifications to community members if they have violated our rules. If you have posted a video, comment, audio, or livestreamed content that we do not allow, you will be notified in the app along with the violation reason. If your account has been banned because of a violation, you will receive a banner notification when you next open the app, informing you of this account change. If you receive a notification of a content violation or account ban and believe that it was done in error, then you can  appeal the decision . You can view the  status of your appeal  in the in-app Safety Center, as well as the status of any reports you have filed about other content or accounts.

20211118,none,December 2020,"Introduction Last updated, December 2020 TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the globe. As we grow, we are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our community. Our Community Guidelines define a set of norms and common code of conduct for TikTok; they provide guidance on what is and is not allowed to make a welcoming space for everyone. At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage in what inspires them; and we believe that a safe environment helps everyone express themselves openly. We deeply value the global nature of our community, and we strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate. We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by only allowing authentic content on TikTok. Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and to everything on TikTok.  We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation before content gets reported to us.  We also encourage our community members to use the  tools we provide on TikTok  to report any content they believe violates our Community Guidelines. We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal if they believe no violation has occurred. We will suspend or ban accounts and/or devices that are involved in severe or repeated violations; we will consider information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions. When warranted, we will report the accounts to relevant legal authorities. Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content – such as spam, videos under review, or videos that could be considered upsetting or depict things that may be shocking to a general audience – we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results or limiting distribution in the For You feed. We recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines could be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content, satirical content, content in fictional settings, counterspeech, and content in the public interest that is newsworthy or otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy. Violent extremism We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok. We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote dangerous individuals or organizations. When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we may suspend or ban the account. When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities. To effectively protect our community, we may consider information available on other platforms and offline to identify violent and extremist individuals and organizations on our platform. If we find such individuals or organizations on TikTok, we will close their accounts.
